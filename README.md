# Energy Planet

## Overview
Energy planet is a visualization of the Earth which shows each countries use of renewable energy. The more smoke that appears over a country means that country is less reliant on renewable energy.

The data for the renewable usage by country comes from  World bank (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.FEC.RNEW.ZS?year_high_desc=false). This data set contains renewable energy usage for most countries from 1990 up to 2014.

The visualization makes use of Node.js to create the image maps of renewable energy for each year. Three.js, WebGL with fragment and vertex shaders provide the smoke overlay.
